<b>Graphics:</b>
<br><br>
All graphics used anywhere in this site, whether in applets or in the layout, are either created by myself or Lawson Bake.  Most of the images on the layout were made by Law, and most of the ones made in the applets were made by me.  An easy way to tell is if something looks cool and photoshoped, it was him, and if something looks like if it was made in Windows Paint, it was me.

<b>Site Layout:</b>
<br><br>
Basic HTML site layout was designed completely by Lawson Bake.  Improvised site layout, using PHP, CSS, and additional HTML, designed by, oh my god, yours truly.  Editor of choice is Windows Notepad.  Browser of choice is FireFox.
