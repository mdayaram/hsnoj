HS Noj
=====

This is the site I used to have back in high school (hence hsnoj).

It went through several iterations and several different hosts (ugtech,
hiya-host, geocities, tripod, etc...).  Unfortunately this code base only
represents the last two iterations.

Revel on the stupidity and ridiculousness that was 17 year old Noj.
I definitely got a few laughs, I'm sure you will too.

Unfortunately there seems to be some things that were lost with time.  I can't
seem to find any of the applets I used to host, nor can I find any of the
content under the media section.  Alas, so it is.
