<h3> July 21, 2005</h3>
As you can see, the 7up pic that used to be up under June 22, 2005 doesn't load anymore.  Let's all thank Law for being an asshole and deleting it from his webspace.  Thanks, ass!

<h3> July 8, 2005</h3>
Oh yes, a <a href="media.php">media</a> page is added! And it's almost empty! How kick ass.

Sweet justice! Linky:  <a href="http://www.freenation.tv/hotellostliberty2.html" target="justice">http://www.freenation.tv/hotellostliberty2.html</a>

A nice little random update.  Nothing new really on the site, except maybe the <a href="http://noj.ugtech.net/revealed.php">bio</a> thing.  A lot of 'behind the scenes' updates, though.  Many changes in the programming part of the layout.  Obviously you guys don't notice any change, but if you're like me and view the source of every page you visit, you should see great improvements.  Granted you can't see the php code, but at least you get a glimpse of the javascript.  w00t for javascript.
