After three laborous hours, I finally finished the stupid guestbook.  Actually, the labor began yesterday night.  I was looking through all the nifty shit in cpanel and stumbled through the CGI scripts they have readily available for you.  Two that caught my eye were Simple Guestbook and Advanced Guestbook.  Obviously, I click on the advanced one because I figure that they'd probably just give you the code and let you edit it the way you want, etc...At least that's what I think when I think of the word 'advanced.'  Anyways, it turns out it's user friendly GUI shit, so I close it.  However, just out of curiosity I click on simple guestbook, and it turns out that this is the one where you can edit the page and etc the way you want it to be.  Down side, they don't give you the CGI code.  And it would've been fine, but the code sucked.  So thus, I research a few methods, and once again, PHP comes to the rescue.  The one that's up now I had to type out of my ass, so it's not that great.  Once I learn some more PHP I might improve it though.
