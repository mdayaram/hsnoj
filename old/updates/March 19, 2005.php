Ok, site layout is up and running, still could use some remodelling, though.  I'm starting to mess with php again, and have found it quite fun and usefull, although, the applets, when called by the php code, don't seem to be working.  I've tried many different types of the code, still, doesn't budge.  However, if you go to the site the applet is stored though, they seem to be working fine.  I'll look into this a little more, see what I can do.  For now you guys will just have to deal with it.
