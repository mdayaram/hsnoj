But yeah, now everything works, everything's fine.  Go..enjoy yourself or whatever.  Good times.<br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="center" bgcolor="#66cc00"><font color="black"><b>April 1, 2005</b></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Ok...something went wrong with the hiya-host.us server, so my whole account got deleted.  That's ok though, I had all my stuff backed up except the comments, which who cares about, anyways?   Anyways, site is now moved to, well, here, at noj.hiya-host.com.  Everything should be working fine, if it doesn't, then too bad.<br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="center" bgcolor="#66cc00"><font color="black"><b>March 27, 2005</b></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Added comment boxes under each applet.  Tell me what you think.  If it's good enough, I might actually change the applet to match your thoughts.  If it isn't, I'll obviously ignore it.

Looks all nice and pretty here, but behind the scenes it's a big mess.  Oh well, fuck that, no one looks there anyways.  Guestbook is ready to use, applets all work.  I'll add more stuff later.  Bleh.<br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="center" bgcolor="#66cc00"><font color="black"><b>March 24, 2005</b></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">After three laborous hours, I finally finished the stupid guestbook.  Actually, the labor began yesterday night.  I was looking through all the nifty shit in cpanel and stumbled through the CGI scripts they have readily available for you.  Two that caught my eye were Simple Guestbook and Advanced Guestbook.  Obviously, I click on the advanced one because I figure that they'd probably just give you the code and let you edit it the way you want, etc...At least that's what I think when I think of the word 'advanced.'  Anyways, it turns out it's user friendly GUI shit, so I close it.  However, just out of curiosity I click on simple guestbook, and it turns out that this is the one where you can edit the page and etc the way you want it to be.  Down side, they don't give you the CGI code.  And it would've been fine, but the code sucked.  So thus, I research a few methods, and once again, PHP comes to the rescue.  The one that's up now I had to type out of my ass, so it's not that great.  Once I learn some more PHP I might improve it though.<br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="center" bgcolor="#66cc00"><font color="black"><b>March 20, 2005</b></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Well, I got the applets to work, some problem with the folder and how php calls things into a page and whatnot.  Instead of trying to be organized and putting things into folders I should've just stuck everything in main in the first place.  Oh well.<br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="center" bgcolor="#66cc00"><font color="black"><b>March 19, 2005</b></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Ok, site layout is up and running, still could use some remodelling, though.  I'm starting to mess with php again, and have found it quite fun and usefull, although, the applets, when called by the php code, don't seem to be working.  I've tried many different types of the code, still, doesn't budge.  However, if you go to the site the applet is stored though, they seem to be working fine.  I'll look into this a little more, see what I can do.  For now you guys will just have to deal with it.<br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="center" bgcolor="#66cc00"><font color="black"><b>March 18, 2005</b></font></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Fifth place...out of 46 teams in New Jersey.  I did 4 out of the 5 programs we submitted.  One of the programs I did, however, was incorrect.  If it wasn't for that, we would've gotten second place.
